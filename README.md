# Resource Theme
for UVU product resource hub

This is a custom Wordpress custom theme for a potential UVU resource website

## Prerequisites for this project 
The ability to save in resources(database)
Some sort of login
It has to run on bluehost shared hosting
Cant incur any ongoing cost (database cost, hosting cost, and such)


## Solution chosen and why
Because I was locked into shared bluhost hosting, running any kind of server side node related stuff will not work(as far as I can tell). This means no React/nextjs no node packages and a continuos api server would not work. Not incurring any ongoing cost not only caused me to be unable to change the hosting situation, it also made it difficult to find a database that would work with the prerequisites. 

### Potential options
- Learn vanilla PHP and Mysql
  - lots of learning involved/ not many great resources 
- PHP framework "Laravel" and Mysql
  - tempting, better resources even for a login/auth - still a lot of learning time
- Wordpress custom theme
  - good resources, less learning, Wordpress is kind of a pain

### Chosen Solution: Wordpress

Wordpress ended up being chosen as it seemed like the least time consuming option. I had some experience in wordpress and I thought maybe I could make it would work 

## Important functions



### Custom WordPress post
The word press custom post works similar to blog post except you can change it to fit any of your needs. The snippet below (found in functions.php) adds a custom post. You can control the name of post and it's different properties through this funciton. You can also reuse it if you want to add a new custom post you just have to change the function name and change the names in the "labels" array.

```
function my_first_post_type()
{
	add_theme_support('post-thumbnails');
	$args = array(


		'labels' => array(
      <!-- Names the custom post -->
			'name' => 'Resources',
			'singular_name' => 'Resource',
		),
    <!-- controls the different properties of the loop -->
		'hierarchical' => true,
		'public' => true,
		'has_archive' => true,
		'menu_icon' => 'dashicons-images-alt2',
		'supports' => array('title', 'editor', 'thumbnail', 'post-formats', 'custom-fields'),
		'taxonomies' => array('category'),
		//'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'resources'),	

	);


	register_post_type('Resources', $args);


}
add_action('init', 'my_first_post_type');
```

### Wordpress Loop
This word press loop allows you to show all the post in a select category or categories. If you want to show more resources you can reuse this loop in other places and change the category or add categories to existing loops.

```
 $args = array(

                'post_type' => 'resources',  <!-- custom post name -->
                'post_status' => 'publish',
                'category_name' => 'news-sources-web-development', <!-- category(s) that the loop loops through -->
                'posts_per_page' => -1  <!-- amount of post shown (negative -1 means no limit) -->

            );



            $loop = new WP_Query($args);


            if ($loop->have_posts()):
                while ($loop->have_posts()):
                    $loop->the_post(); ?>


            


                <?php if (has_post_thumbnail()): ?><!-- pulls the featured image if its there -->
                <img src="<?php the_post_thumbnail_url('blog-small'); ?>" alt="<?php the_title(); ?>">
                <?php endif; ?>


                <h4>
                
                    <?php the_title(); ?><!-- Pulls the title of the custom post -->
                </h4>
                <?php the_content(); ?><!-- Pulls the content -->
                <a href="<?php echo get_post_meta(get_the_ID(), 'Resource Link', true); ?>">Learn More
                    â†’</a>

            

            <?php endwhile; else: endif; ?><!-- end of WordPress loop  -->
```

### Wordpress Navigation
The navigation is run through wordpress as well. They are initialized in the functions.php file then added into each page

#### Initialize navigations in functions.php
```
add_theme_support('menus');

register_nav_menus(
	array(
		'top-menu' => 'Top Menu Location',
		'resource-menu' => 'Resource Menu Location',
		'webdev-resource-menu' => 'Webdev Resource Menu Location',
	)
);
```
#### The navigation function found in each page
```
<?php
        wp_nav_menu(

          array(

            'theme_location' => 'resource-menu',
            'menu_class' => 'resource-menu',
          )


        );
        ?>
```
## Work that needs to be done still (As of April 2024)
- Networking Slide Show
- Vetting and adding more and better resources
- Missing social media links on dev leaders
- Link on large slideshow not yet done
- Large slideshow slides in how they show up and what categories they come from 
- Mobile work 
- The lines are missing or incorrect on the front page
- Buttons have no links right now

- CSS could use some refactoring and simplifying
  - Padding and margins are in px in most cases instead of rem
  - The is some repetitive stuff
  - Some of the earlier H1 heading type things are not done correctly at all
  - The image on the hero has something wrong with it
  - The nav width needs to be limited, the nav layout could be worked out better overall
  - Margin between footer and bottom of content not correct across all pages
  - There is some bad namings the css
  - Could broken up and used with sass to make it not so long.
  - Minify css
- Top Nav selection doesn't stay on "UX" or "webdev" when moving through pages on sub menu (probably needs to be fixed with JS)
